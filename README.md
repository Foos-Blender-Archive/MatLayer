# MatLay
MatLay is an add-on for Blender that drastically speeds up the material workflow by replacing the material node workflow in Blender with a layer stack workflow, offering automation for common mesh map baking, and automating file handling.

Features:
- One-click batch baking for common texture maps.
- Layer stack user interface and workflow.
- Texture set management.
- One-click exporting for material channels.
- Texture file management.

Limitations:
- No layer folders.
- Baking and exporting for textures can be very slow.
- No ID map masking support.
- No displacement layer stack.
