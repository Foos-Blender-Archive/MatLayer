# MatLay
MatLay is an add-on for Blender that speeds up the material workflow by replacing the material node workflow in Blender with a layer stack workflow, offering automation for common mesh map baking, and automating file handling.

Features:
- One-click batch baking for common texture maps.
- Layer stack user interface and workflow.
- Texture set management.
- One-click exporting for material channels.
- Texture file management.

Coming Soon:
- Filters for specific layers and material channels.
- Multiple masks for a specific layer.

Limitations:
- No layer folders.
- Baking for texture maps or exporting can be very slow.
- No ID map masking support.
- No displacement layer stack.
- You can't have multiple material fill / paint types on the same layer.
