MatLay is an add-on for Blender that drastically speeds up the material workflow by replacing the material node workflow in Blender with a layer stack workflow, offering automation for common mesh map baking, and automating file handling.

Pros:
- Free, and always will be
- Layer stack user interface and workflow
- Material layers support multiple filters
- Layers support multiple masks
- One-click baking for mesh maps
- One-click exporting for textures
- Texture set material channel management
- Texture file management
- Supports adding custom group nodes to the layer stack

Cons:
- No layer folders
- Baking and exporting for textures can be very slow
- No ID map masking support
- No displacement layer stack
- Currently no blur filter

Development Principles:
- Simplicity
- Ease of use.
- Workflow Speed
